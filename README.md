- Sensor module implementations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **For C/C++ Programming:**
  - A C/C++ compiler (GCC, MinGW, or MSVC)
  - Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE
  - Git for version control

### Setup Options

1. **GitHub Codespaces** (Recommended for beginners):
   - Fork this repository
   - Open with GitHub Codespaces
   - Select the appropriate dev container configuration

2. **Local Development**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Nikolai-Slsr/study-code.git`
   - Install required compilers and tools (see Lab 1 for detailed instructions)
   - Open the project in your IDE

3. **DHBW Lab Computers**:
   - Follow the specific instructions in Lab 1, Section II

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Lab 1** in the `courses/coding-in-C/` directory to set up your development environment
2. **Progress sequentially** through the labs - each builds on previous concepts
3. **Create your solutions** in the "MySolution" folders within each lab
4. **Reference the solution folders** when you need guidance or want to compare approaches
5. **Practice with additional exercises** in the `Übungen/` directory

## 🎯 Learning Approach

Each lab typically includes:
- **Introduction**: Overview of the concepts covered
- **Tasks**: Step-by-step instructions for the exercise
- **Requirements**: Specific goals and constraints
- **Solutions**: Reference implementations (try solving on your own first!)

## 📝 Lab Topics Overview
